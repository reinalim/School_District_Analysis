# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The school board has noticed an evidence of academic dishonesty from the students_comeplete.csv file, specifically the reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th graders. They want to uphold state-testing standards and replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. This project showcases how these changes affected the overall testing standards and reading and math grades.
